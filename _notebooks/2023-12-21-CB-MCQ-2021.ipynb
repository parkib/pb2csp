    "#### Score/Reflection:\n",
    "My score for this assignment (2021 Practice Exam 1 MCQ) was 54/70. This showcases my understanding for most concepts, while leaving room to still improve. I want to learn more and clear concepts that I’m not quite sure about and/or having a difficult time fully understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improvement \n",
    "Overall, I would say my understand of some concepts like iteration, data compression, computing are mostly strong. Some things I need to work on are reading the questions right and thinking about the option choices more. I tend to choose one answer without reading the others and I think that's a bad habit that I should work on. I can also improve on topics where I'm not to sure about the concepts like boolean expressions ( I forgot how to do them) and calling procedures. I think I just need to go over my notes from trimester 1.\n",

    "## Corrections: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 13:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/dcdc93f8-e638-47da-b0bf-1e30188fd070)\n",
    "The correct answer to this question would be C because collaborators still need to develop strategies to resolve differences of opinion. It is not B because having multiple team members review components of the innovation throughout the process is helpful in identifying and correcting errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 15:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/9f673a49-4d59-4170-ba0d-ec7cc1c0e6a0)\n",
    "The answer I chose for this question was D, the correct answer however is A. This is because that code segment starts at (1, 0). Then, in the loop, there is a call to drawLine and it draws a vertical line of length len. When xVal  increased by 1, next line segment will be drawn one position to the right. By increasing len by 1, next line segment drawn will have length increased by 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 17:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/56a8320f-1ec2-48bc-a4e3-9b1f0d69b7ee)\n",
    "For this question my answer was 3(option A). This is wrong because even if I remove any three connections, devices B and C will still communicate. The correct answer is 4 (option B) because if connections B-A, B-D, B-E, and B-G are removed, then devices B and C can no longer communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 18:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/ff687717-f962-4ece-b8a5-f8e09a3abfa2)\n",
    "The correct answer for this question is C because if devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will be isolated from A, C, D, and I so then the connection between A and G will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 37:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/2aade26c-4b41-4504-95ce-b540ec45a53c)\n",
    "The correct answer to this question is option C (carrot). This is because carrot can only be displayed only when the expression (n > 10) is false and the expression (n > 100) is true. It says it cant be greater than 10, so it cant be greater than 100, and so \"carrot\" can never be displayed.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 44:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/43e84705-6902-4c6b-9a36-658a4d8e8000)\n",
    "The correct answer to this question is option B. This is because the fixed number of bits that is used for real numbers limits the range of the values. This causes round-off errors which result in imprecise values or results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 45:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/7fa66936-9ba8-4952-8f02-9ca29e8d5630)\n",
    "I chose option A but that makes the robot ends one square to the left of the gray square. The correct answer would actually be option C because first call to botStepper moves robot forward 2, rotates it left, moves it forward 2, and rotates it right. Then, the robot moves forward one square. The second call moves robot forward three squares, rotates it left, moves it forward three squares, and rotates it right. So now it is in the gray square.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 46:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/aba02288-553f-463b-91c1-19603481891e)\n",
    "The correct option is option C because the order of the rows is not changed when filters are applied. Order in which the actions are performed don't matter. Filtering can occur before or after the spreadsheet is sorted by rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 48:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/644b3fbc-9ab6-469e-953c-b0e340150e33)\n",
    "The correct answer to this question is option A because the rogue access point is wireless access. This gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 55:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/f0841815-3345-4898-9100-dd27c6a4dd96)\n",
    "The correct answer to this question is option C because the code segment assigns value of last element of list to the variable temp. Then it removes the last element of the list, and then after that inserts temp as the first element of the list. Option B is wrong because it removes the last element of the list, then attempts to access an element at index len.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 57:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/7c145316-28f7-460a-beb9-522e2571ba8f)\n",
    "The correct answer is option A because when there are two processors running in parallel, the execution time is minimized when processors take equal workload. P and Q running on one processor will take 40 seconds. R and S  running will take 35 seconds. All four operations are completed in 40 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 62:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/a99c738a-6233-4019-817d-c7cb9647fb67)\n",
    "The correct answer is option C because users with a premium account dont receive advertisements. I read this question wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 63: \n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/1fe5feca-e91f-4057-a653-b83d399e0eba)\n",
    "The correct answer to this question is option A and D. A is right because when input1 and input2 are true, expressions (NOT input1) and (NOT input2) are false, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will go to false. In other cases, either (NOT input1) or (NOT input2) it will go to true, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 64:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/d48cc13c-02f9-4bb1-9831-01a2d886d8a7)\n",
    "For this question I forgot to choose option D but that option is right because if timer is > 60, there is bonus is assigned 1500 in first IF block. If timer is in middle of 30 and 60, bonus is assigned 1000 in the second IF block. If timer <than 30, bonus is assigned 500 in the third IF block. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 69:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/27a21201-ed56-4528-8449-cb11792aa91b)\n",
    "The correct answer for this question is also D. I only chose option A for this aswell. Option D is also correct because the location and date a photo is taken is metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine if two pictures were taken at same location on different dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 70:\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/parkib/pb2csp/assets/140993655/eb976cf3-9a4b-4dd7-b1e5-917f5d85c2e8)\n",
    "The correct answer for this question is option A and C. A is correct because the code segment assigns characters to the left of position n to the variable left and characters to the right of position n to the variable right. For option C the code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to newStr. The code segment then concatenates newStr with the substring consisting of the characters to the right of position n. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What I can do to improve:\n",
    "Those were all my corrections and I think that I have a ton of room to improve. Things I can do to improve are look over the videos on college board, review team teaches, write more notes on team teaches, and do all the team teach homeworks. I should probably also probably try to incorporate more common variables/commands that I see in the MCQ exams and use them while making my blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things to focus on:\n",
    "I should probably focus on perfecting my concept on boolean epxressions and calling procedures. I also need to touch up on my concepts of lists because it’s been a while since trimester one. I should probably go over all the old team teaches and the notes I took on those topics and go through my past college board quizzes. I should also make myself more familiar with Boolean variables. "
